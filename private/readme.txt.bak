Had issues with linking tables.

10.06.17 (Sibasish)
There are 3 forms in index;
1st form-radio button to select sport goods or sport apparels
2nd form-list of sport goods
3rd form-list of sport apparels

Problem is that if I change any form in browser then form gets submitted and response gets recorded but when I change 1 form after another ie after selecting sports goods I select football then the records of the first form vanishes.


11.06.17 (Sibasish)
Linked SportsApparels for section 2 and 3. Might need another separate table for SportsGoods.

12.06.17 (Bodha)
Created 3 more tables- ProductSport, ProductBrand, ProductGoodsList.
Written code for linking sports goods(in controller) but can't figure out the code for the frontend.

Deleted table ProductBrand and added two new columns in a new column in ProductGoodsList named ProductType and refernced it to ProductSport
Linked remaining part of SportsGooods for Section 2 and Section 3
